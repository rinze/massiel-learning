# First Massiel Learning prototype

Detects Massiel's 'Lalala' hit from lyrics files. Machine learning gone awry.

Usage:

```python
python massielLearning.py < data/massiel1.txt 
Probably Massiel
python massielLearning.py < /etc/init.d/networking 
Probably not Massiel
```

Don't try to use it on production systems.
